The model was built using the following:
1) TensorFlow
2) OpenCV
3) imutils


The model provided:
Accuracy: 100% on validation set
          99% on training set

The model was trained using state of the art inception_v3 model.


Observation:
The model performed well on portrait images but had difficulty in detection when it came to images with a lot of tiny faces.
This is because of the fact that the model was trained with small input size (256x256) due to limitation of computational power from my end.
Training a network with larger dimensions would help rectify this issue.
Also, acquiring a larger dataset would help improve the efficiency of the model.

When it came to videos, the processing was slow (again because of limited computational power from my end).
This can be rectified training the model on a cloud service like IBM Watson Studio, Microsoft Azure, Google colab etc.

Further scope of improvement exists in video processing where one can make the model detect multiple faces at the same time in an efficient manner.
